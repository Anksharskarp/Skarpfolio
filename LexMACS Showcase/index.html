        Special Containment Procedures and Rules:
    <ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Any access to SCP-261 must be approved by staff with Y-E-E security
            clearance or higher.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            - Any and all items dispensed by SCP-261 must be recorded, along with the amount of money
            entered and the amount of time elapsed between uses.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            - Currently, SCP-261 may be used <strike>only ten times in a
            twenty-four-hour period, with no transaction exceeding the equivalent of 500 Japanese yen</strike> as much
            as one pleases to, and with any sum of money that is imaginable, provided that William Zhang approves of it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Testing approved by William Zhang himself is not under any restriction.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Items dispensed by SCP-261 should be reviewed by Site Health and Safety officials before consumption.
            Failure to do so releases the Foundation from any obligation regarding negative effects. Items deemed
            dangerous
            or useful to research will be confiscated by site security, with financial compensation provided in
            proportion
            to money spent.
        </li>
        <br>

            Log of items vended during Testing Phases:
            800 yen entered for each item, items being dispensed every 2 minutes. SCP-261 is attached to power.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Coke Zero</b> A can of diet Coke, packaging in English.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Cheetos</b> A small bag of Cheetos snack food, packaging in English.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Black Black</b> A single pack of caffeinated chewing gum, packaging in Japanese.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Yan Yan</b> A single Yan Yan cone, with peach dipping frosting, packaging in Japanese.
            The Meiji Seika Company does not produce this flavor.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Pepsi: Dragon Twist</b> A can of Pepsi cola, with a trace of fruit flavor, packaging in English.
            Flavor identified as Dragon Fruit. PepsiCo does not produce this product.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Darkside Cola</b> A can with clear plastic sides, packaging in Japanese. Liquid inside is clear.
            When opened, liquid appears to react to the air, and changes to dark black over a period of several seconds.
            The black coloration looks like billowing smoke, and cannot be reversed. The taste is described as
            cola, with something spicy in it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Little Bakery: 7 Grain</b> A small tube the size of a candy bar with a green button, made of
            aluminum, packaging in English. When the top is twisted off, a mass of dough is extruded.
            Dough contains several enzymes and bacteria that have not yet been identified. On contact with air,
            these cause the dough to rise and bake, killing the microbes in the process. Produces a small, round
            loaf of bread weighing 250 grams. Taste described as good, but chewy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Lemon Clams</b> Thick plastic baggie with a plastic tube on the side, containing water and twelve
            clams, packaging in Dutch. Following on-package instructions, the plastic tube was cracked like a
            glow stick. Liquid in the bag flashed to steam, venting from a hole that popped open in the top of
            the bag, slightly burning one researcher. Steaming finished after thirty-eight seconds, after which
            clams were found to be fully cooked and infused with a mild lemon flavor. On investigation, clams match
            no recorded species.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Diet Ghost</b> A can containing an instance of SCP-2107. Packaging was in English. Testing done on
            this instance provided similar results to other contained instances of SCP-2107. This marks the first
            time SCP-261 has vended another SCP object.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Amogus</b> An amogus that sings songs from the video game Among Us and does fun stuff; great person
            but brings along its many, many friends, which will start a wild party in your house that will never end.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Unknown(?)</b> Small mesh bag filled with small, multicolored pyramids, packaging in an unknown
            language. Pyramids found to be very hard and unpleasant tasting, compared to chalk in taste and
            consistency. When placed in hot water, pyramids open and produce strings that quickly dissolve, coloring
            the water the same shade as the pyramid. Water had no additional taste, but testing revealed a sharp
            increase in mineral, carbohydrate, and protein content, with several minerals unidentified at the
            present time. This content was found to be consistent with the recommended daily intake of nutrients for
            adult humans. Researcher ingesting the water reported stomach cramps two hours later, but no other effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Unknown(??)</b> Aluminum box with a small glass window on the side, and a large round button on the
            top, packaging in an unknown language. Box is seamless, and appears to be filled with small, round
            animals covered in fur, each with three small paws and a single large eye. Pressing the button causes
            the inside of the box to rapidly become super-heated, cooking the small animals alive. Muffled noises
            and scratching were heard for several seconds during the cooking process. After one minute,
            thirty seconds, the front panel opens and gives access to the now-cooked animals. Professor Kain
            volunteered to eat the animals, with no other researchers willing to do so. Taste described as crunchy
            and very spicy, with a small hint of beef.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Unknown</b> Tall, thin aluminum can, packaging in an unknown language. Opening the can caused a
            chemical reaction with the liquid inside the can. Liquid was apparently not intended for an oxygenated
            atmosphere, and detonated violently, causing several injuries and killing two researchers. Testing
            discontinued, and area cleared. Testing area observed to smell like citrus for several days.
