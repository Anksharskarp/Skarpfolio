# Skarpfolio

A centralized repository for all of my mini software projects that aren't large enough to have a separate repository for their own.
This serves both as a porfolio to showcase my software projects and also as a learning resources for any deveopers aiming to upskill themselves.
The code on the main branch should be well-maintained, high-quality, and well-documented. If that isn't the case, feel free to open a pull request or an issue 
with your questions, concerns, suggested improvements, or even some interesting insights on software development, data structures, and algorithms pertaining to
the projects here!
